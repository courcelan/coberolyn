                      <p>Aly and Carolyn’s friendship goes back to 1996. Also an only child, having gotten through the awkward teen years together, years of playing softball and tennis together, and spending endless summer days riding bikes, and going to the mall, their childhood friendship was solid. They once got busted for curfew by the cops and cried about it. Secretly their parents were both so relieved that they finally got into a little trouble. No one likes a goody-two-shoes!</p>

                      <p>Cassie and Carolyn became friends in 1996. Also an only child, along with Aly, they became like sisters to each other. Cassie, having an incredible wardrobe for a teenager, threw her scraps to Carolyn and Aly, including a sacred Margaritaville t-shirt with thumbholes (hey, it was the 90’s and it was cool!). Cassie has always been incredibly strong inside and out. She has no fear. No fear of playing rugby, no fear of living in Thailand, and certainly no fear of riding side-saddle on a speedbike through Bangkok.</p>

It worked 99% of the time. Their moms used to work together and were good friends, Carolyn’s mom having been Tricia’s godmother.

They became fast friends and quickly integrated with each other’s circle of friends.

They founded their company, Wellfire Interactive, seven years ago, which means he and Cobey have had almost as many life-planning discussions as bride and groom. Ben lives in Richmond, VA with his VCU professor wife, Lisa, but still mananges to send jokes to Cobey daily.</p>

Amy, coming into Accenture with several more years’ experience than Carolyn, filled the role of friend and mentor for her. A die-hard Capitals fan, she lives for hockey season, but also lives for her friends, and Vegas!</p>

                    <p>Matt's JMU's biggest fan, but he and Cobey became friends after meeting while both were visiting UVA post-graduation. Matt is an avid homebrewer who makes some very tasty libations. Through countless adventures through out DC, Virginia, and Delaware, Matt eventually moved with his wonderful wife, Annie, to Seattle, but not before Matt wandered seven miles in a seersucker jacket and pajama pants back to Cobey's mom's house. The annual Foxfield Races trip certainly leaves an impression!</p>

                    <p>Kuma is Cobey and Carolyn's lovely Shiba Inu. He joined their family three years ago for Carolyn's birthday and has been quite an impression on them since then. He hangs out all work day with Cobey and, once 5pm hits, sits facing the front door, waiting for Carolyn to get home. Kuma hates pools but loves the ocean and wants to go everywhere with his family. Unfortunately he won't be attending the wedding, but he's planning on being in Charlottesville just the same.</p>
